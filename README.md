## Why this project?
This project is a first look at the business idea generated by my friends and I after my studies abroad in Japan. 

We found that many foreigners in Japan are lacking support for doing the activities they want to do, and that we could help fulfil this need. 

In an effort to bring this idea to fruition, this website will serve as the starting point for the business and allow us to start providing our travel services to our users.

## Development Setup
1. Pull the code from this repo.
2. Navigate to the `GoGoSumo.Server` directory and run the `docker compose up` command in your terminal.
3. The following should now be available:
  - PgAdmin should now be running on `http://localhost:15432/browser/`
  - Postgres should be running on port `5432` and setup with Flyway migrations
  - Debug the REST API server (which is using Swagger) with Visual Studio, or run the frontend with `npm run dev` in the `gogosumo.client` directory
